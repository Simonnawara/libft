# libft

This is the code for the libft library, a collection of custom-written C functions that are commonly used in many projects. The library includes functions for string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list management, among others.

The code is divided into the libft project itself with a few additional custom function, the printf project, and the get_next_line project, to combine every useful functions into one library.

## Instructions
To compile the code, run `make` in the terminal. This will create a library called `libft.a`.

To clean the object files and library, run `make clean` and `make fclean`, respectively.

The library is accompanied by a header file called libft.h, which contains prototypes for all the functions in the library. To use the library in your project, include the header file and link to the library as described above.
